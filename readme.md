My little folio site. By the time you're reading this I already hate it.

It's a custom Wp build. Gulp for tasks. ACF for fields

## Project

The `src` directory is for authoring build/site/theme assets - namely scss/js/images. Used to do all theme authorship within src and let the whole project build out - php files an all. But, with Wp that can be a no joke pain mane.

## Run

- `npm install gulp --save-dev` to install gulp dependencies
- `gulp` to run the project
- Profit.
